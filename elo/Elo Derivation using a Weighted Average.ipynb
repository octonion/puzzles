    "# A Derivaton of Elo's Rating System from a Weighted Expectation Average"

    "Arpad Elo's rating system, most famously applied to chess, is commonly used and described, but rarely explained in the sense of a derivation. Here's one possible (and hopefully insightful) derivation using a weighted average between the expected and actual outcomes."

    "Say we have a function that gives us the expected outcome between players with ratings $R_1$ and $R_2$. Furthermore, suppose that this function $f$ only depends on the difference $R_1-R_2$; i.e. $E = f(R_1-R_2)$ gives us the expected score (from the perspective of player 1) between players with ratings $R_1$ and $R_2$. Now say we observe the outcome of a match between these two players, and player 1 scores $S$. If $S > E$, it's reasonable to guess that player 1 is probably stronger than $R_1$, and player 2 is probably weaker than $R_2$; if $S < E$, the opposite is likely true. Of course, of $S = E$, we're not at all surprised by the outcome, and satisfied by the ratings."

    "How should be adjust $R_1$ and $R_2$ when we're suprised (perhaps only slightly) by the outcome? Let's make the additional assumption that whatever change occurs to $R_1$, an equal but opposite change is made to $R_2$. That is, if $R_1'$ and $R_2'$ are the new adjusted ratings, $R_1 + R_2 = R_1' + R_2'$. If $R_1' = R_1 + d$, this means that $R_2' = R_2-d$."

    "A reasonable idea is that the new expected outcome should be somewhere between the observed outcome and our initial expected outcome. Mathematically, we can write this statement as $$f(R_1+d-(R_2-d)) = w S + (1-w) f(R_1-R_2).$$ We now approximate the left side linearly, and so $$f(R_1-R_2+2d) \\approx f(R_1-R_2) + f'(R_1-R_2) (2d).$$ This gives us the equation $$ d = \\frac{w}{2f'(R_1-R_2)} (S-E),$$ which is precisely Elo's original updating function, assuming $f'(R_1-R_2)$ is approximately a constant, which is reasonable so long as players tend to play those of a similar strength."
