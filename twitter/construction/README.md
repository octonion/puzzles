Using only the operations of ! (factorial), sqrt() and floor(), can you construct any positive integer starting with a 3?

```
sage factorial_sqrt.sage
```

```
python factorial_sqrt.py
```

```
ruby factorial_sqrt.rb
```

```
gnatmake -Ofast -gnatp -gnat2022 factorial_sqrt.adb
./factorial_sqrt
```

```
julia factorial_sqrt.jl
```

```
chpl --fast factorial_sqrt.chpl
./factorial_sqrt
```

```
ldc2 -O3 factorial_sqrt.d
./factorial_sqrt
```

```
g++ -march=native -m64 -O3 factorial_sqrt.cpp -lgmpxx -lgmp
./a.out
```
